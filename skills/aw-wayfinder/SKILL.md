# Wayfinder

An epic-route effort has arrived: too big for one agent session, and wrapped in fog, so the way from here to its **destination** isn't visible yet. Chart that way as a **map** in the tracker, then work its **decision tickets** one at a time until nothing is left to decide. The map and its decision tickets are this phase's artifact (ADR 0010).

## Configuration

Find the repo's `## Agent skills` block: look in `AGENTS.md`, then `CLAUDE.md`, then `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, and follow its pointers to the tracker, VCS and checks adapters and the domain doc. Use each operation the way the adapter's Operations table says, at its access level: a write at `draft` is not performed; write its exact command or text to `.aw/drafts/<yyyymmdd-hhmmss>-<operation>.md` and tell the user the path. Where the block or an adapter is missing, use the defaults below.

## Defaults when unconfigured

When the block or an adapter is missing, a skill keeps going on these defaults and says once per session: "using defaults, run `/aw-setup`".

| Adapter | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Tracker | `none`: the task arrives as free text, reads find nothing, and every write leaves a draft. `aw-wayfinder`, which needs a tracker, offers to create a local-markdown one. |
| VCS | git. The base branch and diff base are the default branch (`git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`, else `main` or `master`), which is also the one protected branch. `start-branch` and `commit` are at `write`; `push`, `open-review` and `merge` are at `draft`. |
| Checks | No configured commands. A skill proposes commands from the project's manifest, runs them when it needs a level, and never reports a level as passed unless it ran it. |
| Domain | Single-context: `GLOSSARY.md` and `docs/adr/` at the root, read when present. |

## Never allowed

Whatever the access levels say, the agent never force-pushes (`--force`, `--force-with-lease`, a `+` refspec), never deletes a branch, local or remote, never pushes directly to a protected branch, and never passes `--no-verify`. These are not configurable.

## Decide, then hand off

Every ticket on the map asks a question whose answer is a decision, and the map is done when nothing is left to decide. The destination is always one or more **deliverables**, each a change that deserves its own spec, or for an investigation an answer. When the map clears, each deliverable goes to `/aw-spec`, which writes its spec and holds it for its own spec approval, then down the standard route (ADR 0013).

So this skill's output is decisions, recorded in the tracker; the code, the specs and the slice plans come later, from the skills that own them. The pull to start on the work itself is the signal you have reached the edge of the map. That holds whatever the map's **Notes** or a ticket say: a Note that claims the map carries execution is wrong, so say so and set it aside. A `task` ticket that reads like a slice of the build ("build the X") is mis-typed: retype it as a question, or rule it out of scope.

## The tracker

This is the one skill that needs a tracker: the map has to live somewhere every later session can read. Read the tracker adapter, or take the default.

**Tracker `none`**, configured or by default: before anything else, offer to create a local-markdown tracker. Tell the user that the map needs a tracker, and that a local-markdown one keeps one file per ticket in `docs/tickets/`, committed with the repo, and never under `docs/specs/`. Ask whether to create it there or in another folder they name. When they decline, stop: name `/aw-setup` to configure another tracker, and chart nothing. When they accept:

1. Fill [`adapters/tracker-local.md`](adapters/tracker-local.md), a copy of the template `/aw-setup` uses: replace `{{tickets-dir}}` with the folder, keep `**Default access:** \`write\`` and every row's access, and drop the template's opening note.
2. Choose where it goes: the file the block's `### Tracker` subsection points to, replacing the `none` adapter there; when there is no such pointer, the path `/aw-setup` writes, `docs/agents/tracker.md`.
3. Choose the block change. When a block exists, in `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` or `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, replace its `### Tracker` subsection, or add one at the top of the block, and change nothing else. When none exists, add the block to `AGENTS.md`, else to an existing `CLAUDE.md` (root or `.claude/`), else create `AGENTS.md`, with only this subsection:

   ```markdown
   ## Agent skills

   ### Tracker

   Local markdown: one file per ticket in `<tickets-dir>`. See `<adapter path>`.
   ```

4. Show the user the adapter, its path and the block change, and write them once they confirm. Read the adapter back and work on it from here, as on any configured tracker.
5. Commit the adapter and the block, and later the ticket files, through the VCS adapter's `commit`. When the current branch is protected, `start-branch` a work branch first, and tell the user that the map lives on that branch: later sessions run on it until it is merged.

Done when the user declined and you stopped, or the adapter and the block are written and committed.

**Any other tracker**: use it as its adapter says. Every tracker write below goes through a canonical operation: the map and its tickets through `publish-ticket`, part-of and blocking edges through `link-tickets`, claims and closes through `set-status`, answers and map updates through `comment-ticket`. At `draft`, each one leaves its draft, as **Drafts** says.

## The map

The map is a single ticket. Its title names the effort; its body opens with the line `Type: wayfinder:map`, followed by:

```markdown
## Destination

<what reaching the end of this map looks like: the deliverables, each a change that deserves its own spec, or the answer an investigation is after. One or two lines; every session orients to it before choosing a ticket.>

## Notes

<the domain; the skills every session should consult; standing preferences for this effort. Never permission to build.>

## Tickets

None yet.

## Decisions so far

None yet.

## Not yet specified

<the fog: in-scope questions you can tell are coming but cannot yet state precisely>

## Out of scope

<work ruled beyond the destination>
```

The map is an **index**, not a store. **Tickets** lists each open decision ticket in publishing order, one line each: `- <name, with its key or link>: <type>, blocked by <keys, or "none">`. **Decisions so far** lists each closed one with the gist of its answer and links the ticket that holds its detail: a decision lives in exactly one place, its ticket, and the map only gives its gist. Whether a ticket is still open or claimed is the tracker's to say: `fetch-ticket` it, never trust the list for that.

The canonical operations cannot rewrite a ticket's body, so the map changes through **map updates**: a `comment-ticket` on the map that opens with the line `**Map update**` and holds the whole current Tickets, Decisions so far, Not yet specified and Out of scope sections, each headed `#### <section>`, a level that never ends a tracker's comments section. The latest map update is the map's current state; the body keeps the Destination and Notes. To load the map, `fetch-ticket` it and read its body and its latest map update, not every ticket. Other sessions may post map updates too: `fetch-ticket` the map again just before posting one, and carry over every line it added.

## Decision tickets

Each decision ticket is linked as part of the map with `link-tickets`. Its title is its **name**, and its body is the question, sized to one agent session:

```markdown
Type: wayfinder:<type>, <HITL or AFK>
Map: <the map's key>

## Question

<the decision or investigation this ticket resolves>
```

The type is one of `grilling`, `prototype`, `research` or `task`, below. When the adapter's `publish-ticket` takes labels, also give the map and each ticket its `wayfinder:<type>` label; where the tracker rejects a label that does not exist yet, publish without it, since the `Type:` line is the record. A decision ticket carries no other label, such as a triage label: it is a decision, not implementation work.

Refer to the map and its tickets by **name** in everything the user reads, with the key or link inside the name, never a bare key in its place: a wall of `#42, #43, #44` is illegible.

Every ticket is **HITL**, worked with a person who speaks for themselves, or **AFK**, driven by the agent alone. A HITL ticket resolves only through that live exchange: never answer its questions for the user, and never pick among the options a prototype shows them.

- **grilling** (HITL), the default: a question settled by talking it through. Call the Skill tool with "aw-grilling" and with "aw-domain-modeling".
- **prototype** (HITL): "how should it look" or "how should it behave", which talk cannot settle. Call the Skill tool with "aw-prototype" for a cheap, rough artifact to react to, link it from the ticket, and let the user choose.
- **research** (AFK): a fact outside the working directory that a decision waits on, such as a third-party API or documentation. Resolved by a subagent with a fresh context window that calls the Skill tool with "aw-research".
- **task** (HITL or AFK): work that must happen before a decision can be made, with nothing to decide itself, such as provisioning access or moving data so its shape can be seen. It earns its place by unblocking a decision, never by delivering part of the destination. The agent does it alone where it can; otherwise it hands the user a precise checklist. Its answer records what was done and the facts later tickets depend on.

A ticket is **unblocked** when every ticket blocking it is `done`. The **frontier** is the map's open, unblocked, unclaimed tickets: the edge of what is known. Find it from the map's Tickets list: `fetch-ticket` each listed ticket that is not yet known to be done, in order, and keep those still open and not `in-progress` whose blockers are all `done`. A session **claims** a ticket with `set-status` to `in-progress` before any work on it, so that other sessions skip it.

## Fog and scope

The map is deliberately incomplete: don't chart what you can't yet see. **Fog or ticket?** The test is whether you can state the question precisely now, not whether you can answer it now. A sharp question becomes a ticket, even when it is blocked; a question you cannot yet phrase that sharply goes in **Not yet specified**, coarser than a ticket. Don't pre-slice the fog: one patch may become several tickets, or none, once the frontier reaches it. Resolving a ticket clears the fog ahead of it, and whatever it makes specifiable **graduates** into new tickets and leaves Not yet specified, so it lives in one place only.

The destination fixes the scope. Work beyond it is **out of scope**, not fog, and never graduates. When a ticket turns out to sit past the destination, `set-status` it to `done` with a `comment-ticket` that says why, and move its line from Tickets to Out of scope, with the gist and the reason. It stays out of Decisions so far, which records only the route walked.

## Steps

Never resolve more than one ticket per session, except research tickets, which subagents resolve.

When the user names a map, by key, link or name, go to **Work through the map**. When they bring an effort, from the `/aw-intake` report in this conversation or in their own words, go to **Chart the map**. When there is no intake report, say so, suggest running `/aw-intake` first, and go on only if the user asks you to.

In either mode, first settle **The tracker**, read the glossary and the ADRs the domain doc points to, and use the glossary's terms in every ticket.

### Chart the map

1. **Name the destination.** Call the Skill tool with "aw-grilling" and with "aw-domain-modeling", and pin down what this map is finding its way to: the deliverables, or the answer. It fixes the scope, so settle it first. Done when the user agrees the destination in one or two lines.
2. **Map the frontier.** Grill again, breadth-first: fan out across the whole space rather than deep on one thread, and surface the open decisions and the first ones takeable now. Read the code the effort touches, and answer from it whatever it can answer. **When this finds no fog**, because the way is already clear and the whole effort fits in one session, you need no map: say so, name `/aw-spec` for the change, or `/aw-intake` to classify it again, and stop. Done when you can list the tickets you can state now, each with its type and blockers, and the fog you cannot.
3. **Publish the map**: `publish-ticket` it, with the Destination and Notes filled in, Tickets and Decisions so far empty, and the fog sketched into Not yet specified. Done when the map has a key, or is drafted.
4. **Publish the tickets you can state now**, in an order that puts each blocker before the tickets it blocks, with the map's key in each `Map:` line. Then wire them in a second pass, once each one has a key: `link-tickets` each one as part of the map, and each blocked ticket as blocked by its blockers; write any cross-reference between tickets in that pass too, with real keys. Then post the first map update, listing every ticket under Tickets with its type and blockers. Done when every ticket is published, wired and listed, or drafted.
5. **Fire the research subagents**, once the research tickets have keys. For each one, start a subagent with a fresh context window that calls the Skill tool with "aw-research". Run them in parallel, each in a git worktree of its own on a `research/<ticket-slug>` branch it creates with `start-branch`. It commits its findings with `commit`, `push`es the branch at the VCS adapter's access level, and opens no review request: the branch is never merged. When they return, record each one's resolution, as step 4 of **Work through the map** says, with a pointer to the branch and the findings file, in one map update for all of them. When the tickets are still drafts at the end of the session, fire nothing: the research tickets stay on the frontier for **Work through the map**. Done when every research ticket is resolved and recorded, or left on the frontier.
6. **Stop.** Charting is one session's work: resolve no other ticket. Report as **Report** says.

### Work through the map

1. **Load the map**: its body and its latest map update, not every ticket body. Done when you know its destination, its Tickets and its fog.
2. **Choose the ticket.** Find the frontier, as **Decision tickets** says. Take the ticket the user names; otherwise the first frontier ticket in the Tickets list. Claim it with `set-status` to `in-progress` before any work. When the frontier is empty and tickets are still open, they are all claimed or blocked: say which, and stop. A `research` ticket on the frontier is resolved by a subagent, as step 5 of **Chart the map** says. Done when one ticket is claimed.
3. **Resolve it** as its `Type:` line says. Fetch any related or closed ticket in full as you need it, and call the Skill tool for each skill the map's Notes name. If in doubt, call the Skill tool with "aw-grilling" and with "aw-domain-modeling". Done when the question has an answer: for a HITL ticket, one the user gave or chose.
4. **Record the resolution**: `comment-ticket` the answer on the ticket as its resolution comment, `set-status` it to `done`, and move its line from Tickets to Decisions so far as `- <name, with its key or link>: <one-line gist of the answer>`. Link any asset the resolution produced, such as a prototype or research findings, from the ticket; never paste it in. Done when the ticket is `done` with its answer, or both are drafted.
5. **Advance the frontier.** Publish and wire the tickets the answer surfaced, and add them to Tickets; graduate the fog it made specifiable, clearing each graduated patch from Not yet specified. Rule out of scope any ticket the answer shows to sit past the destination. When the answer invalidates other tickets, `comment-ticket` each one with what changed, and close those it makes moot. Post every change to the map's sections, step 4's included, in one map update. Done when the map update is posted, or drafted.
6. **Stop**, and report. When the map has cleared, go to **Hand off** first.

Other sessions may work unblocked tickets in parallel, so expect the tracker to change under you: find the frontier again just before claiming.

### Hand off

The map has **cleared** when its Tickets list is empty and its Not yet specified section is empty: nothing is left to decide before the deliverables are built.

1. **List the deliverables.** From the destination and the decisions so far, list each change that deserves its own spec, with a name, its type (feature, bug, refactor or performance), one or two lines on what it changes, and the decision tickets it rests on. An investigation's map ends in its answer, citing the tickets that hold it, and lists a deliverable only for work the answer shows to do. Done when every decision so far is covered by a deliverable, or by the answer.
2. **Agree them with the user**: whether each deliverable is one change, or should be split or merged, and the order to spec them in. Done when the user agrees the list.
3. **Record the hand-off**: one last map update that adds a `#### Deliverables` section with the agreed list. Leave the map open, as the effort's index, for the user to close once its deliverables ship: no deliverable's spec takes the map as its ticket, so shipping one does not close it. Done when the map update is posted, or drafted.
4. **Name `/aw-spec` for each deliverable**, as **Report** says. Each one gets its own spec and its own spec approval, in a session of its own. This skill never runs it.

## Drafts

When `publish-ticket` is at `draft`, publish nothing: write the map and every ticket, in publishing order, to one draft, `.aw/drafts/<yyyymmdd-hhmmss>-publish-ticket.md`, and every edge to `.aw/drafts/<yyyymmdd-hhmmss>-link-tickets.md`, naming a ticket that does not exist yet as `<key of the map>` or `<key of ticket n>`, in its `Map:` line too. Tell the user both paths, the order to apply them in, and to give you the keys once the tickets exist. When they do, in this session, post the first map update with the real keys and go on to step 5 of **Chart the map**; otherwise draft the map update too, with the same placeholders. When only `link-tickets` is at `draft`, write the edges with the real keys to one draft. A `comment-ticket` or `set-status` at `draft` leaves its own draft; a session that drafted its claim tells the user, since no other session can see it until it is applied.

## Report

Report in chat:

- the map, by name with its key, or its draft path;
- what this session did: the tickets published with their types and blockers, the ticket resolved and its answer in one line, the research resolved, the tickets ruled out of scope;
- the frontier now, by name, and what is left in Not yet specified;
- every draft written, with its path.

Then name what comes next:

- **the map is not clear**: `/aw-wayfinder` again with the map, in a fresh session, to work the next frontier ticket.
- **the map has cleared**: `/aw-spec` for each deliverable, one line each, naming the deliverable and the map. A bug, refactor or performance deliverable needs its pre-step first: its line names `/aw-intake` on the deliverable, then `/aw-spec` in the same conversation, both naming the deliverable and the map. When an investigation's answer shows no work to do, there is no next skill.

Tell the user to run the next skill; this skill never runs it.
